# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Concerned about the increasingly negative impact caused by cancellations, the Revenue Manager Director of a hotel chain with resort and city hotels in Portugal, hired a consultant to evaluate the possibility of developing predictive models to predict net demand* for their hotels. The hotel provided the consultant datasets of one resort hotel (H1) and of one city hotel (H2), of bookings that were due to arrive between July 1, 2015, and August 31, 2017.

The name of the individual and the company name is anonymized to protect confidentiality. The referenced data are real.

*Net demand is defined as demand minus cancellations.
